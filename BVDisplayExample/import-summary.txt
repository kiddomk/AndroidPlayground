ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* BazaarVoice.iml
* BazaarVoice.ipr
* BazaarVoice.iws
* LICENSE-2.0.html
* Templates/
* Templates/AnswerDisplay.txt
* Templates/CategoryDisplay.txt
* Templates/CommentDisplay.txt
* Templates/ProductDisplay.txt
* Templates/ProfileDisplay.txt
* Templates/QuestionDisplay.txt
* Templates/ReviewDisplay.txt
* Templates/StoryDisplay.txt
* ant.properties
* build.xml
* proguard-project.txt
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => bazaarAndroidSDK/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => bazaarAndroidSDK/src/main/res/
* src/ => bazaarAndroidSDK/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
